TODO : 
- Find a branch naming system
- Setup Jira
- Forking CAF (UM)
- Updates and various fixes on CAF
- Add OSS voLTE (h2o64 will do)
- Discuss about adding OMS
- Draw some brandings
- Add YU devices support

RULES:
- We aren't another ROM-copy pasta, commits needs original authorship and descriptive content.
- We will stay as close to CAF UX as possible
	|
	-> As a consequence, most of the patches picked from other OSS projects must be bug fixes and not "features"
